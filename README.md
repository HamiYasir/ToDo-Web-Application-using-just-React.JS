ABOUT THIS PROJECT
==================
This is a web app for implementing a Todo Web Application. I am developing this project to build my grasp on React.Js. While I already have a project on MERN Stack, this project is going to be focused on just React.Js. 

This project is done as part of Smolijames 8hrs React.Js Tutorial and is 1 out of the 3 projects that I will be developing.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
